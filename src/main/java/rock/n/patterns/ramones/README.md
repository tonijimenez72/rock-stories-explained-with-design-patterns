# Ramones Strategy
In the mid-70s, four guys from Queens decided to start a band.
They couldn’t play, they couldn’t sing, and they had no idea who would do what.
All they knew was they wanted to make noise.

What does this have to do with Java?
Everything.

### First rerehearsal
The Ramones' first rehearsal is the perfect example of a poorly designed class:
a monolithic class where everyone does everything, regardless of whether it makes sense or not.

It works, sure.
But it’s chaotic, repetitive, and not flexible at all.
